    <h2>A little about myself: My Odyssey into Web Development</h2>
    <p>I like to consider myself a bit of a nerd. I like stuff such as <em>Pokemon,
    Gundam, Starwars, Marvel</em> and well as other "<strong>nerdy</strong>" things. In my off time I like to watch movies
    as well as work out. I am currently working on becoming a web developer by using free online
    resources such as Khan Academy and CodeAcademy. I decided its time for a change and I have to take charge of that change. 
    I have a background in IT but found out I would rather not be yelled at by angry users <strong>all</strong> day. 
    Im really liking web development and hope a little hard work and determination will go a long way. 
    Anyways, I guess I should start a <em><a href="#khanblog">blog</a></em> about my mental ramblings during the whole process.</p>
