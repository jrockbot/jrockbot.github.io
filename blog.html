        <p class="blogcontent">I've been making my way through the Khan academy programming lesson over the past few weeks.
          Im going at a pretty steady pace; one lesson set every weekday. I was able to get through the Intro to javaScript pretty easily but I definitly need to get back to practicing as I find it's very easy to forget things moving through the course.
          I think I should look up java challenges or something. Anyways, i've made it to the HTML/CSS portion of the programming course.
          I have to say I like it. I find it fairly easiy compared to java concepts although I do have to memorize a bunch of tags. I've always been terrible at memorizing, but it just one of thoughs things I have to get past. --dig in--</p>

        <p class="blogcontent">Intro to HTML/CSS seems to be deceptivly easiy. But I know I have barely scratched the surface.
          I say this because i've been be viewing the source code for different site to see how a page really looks(ctrl+u for windows in the browser), and in all honesty it looks intimidating.
          But I know I cant start feeling like ill never get there because those people had to start from somewhere, right? Anyhow ive been looking over text properties and combining them with other things ive learned so far like images, links, id's and classes, CSS style rules as well as other tags.
          Im gonna try to keep up with this blog using HTML/CSS as I do see a benifit. Honestly, its helping me wrap up my day and seal in information. --I fear I may like it--
